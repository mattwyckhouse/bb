# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — `bb-plugin-finite-state`

_Owner: Matt Wyckhouse. Status: ready to dispatch under the FS-93 scheduling gates. This is the tech-lead document — read before assigning any work. It converts SPECs 00–08 into a repo, a dependency graph, eleven logical lanes, and a set of frozen interfaces that let those lanes run without colliding. SPECs 07–08 were adopted 2026-08-12, after the freeze: their intake is §5.2, their WPs are WP-71…WP-98, and their frozen-contract changes are the proposed AMD-0010…AMD-0014 entries in `AMENDMENTS.md`._

**Companion artifacts:** `HANDOFF — Product & Architecture.md` (self-contained product and system overview) · `ADR — Direct APIs & Optional Forge Compute.md` (current integration ruling) · `api-reference/` (vendored reviewed API snapshots) · `AGENTS.md` (the instruction file every coding agent reads) · `tasks/WP-*.md` (the work packages) · `scheduling/PROGRAM-BOOTSTRAP.md` (binding decisions and model policy) · `scheduling/wp-coupling-manifest.json` (effective dispatch graph) · `scheduling/COORDINATOR-RUNBOOK.md` (cap and dispatch procedure) · `RECON — bb SDK & Forge Surface.md` (historical code-grounded recon, superseded by the ADR where noted).

## 0. What changed after recon — read this first

We ran code-level reconnaissance of bb, Forge, the Platform API, and Assurance Studio before planning. The first pass found nine corrections; the later Forge source audit added the load-bearing integration ruling in row 10. All are reflected in SPECs 00–06.

| #   | What the spec assumed                                          | What the code actually says                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Impact                                                                                                                     |

| 1   | Forge needs new VEX wrappers                                   | The Platform already exposes the required VEX routes, and the plugin calls them directly through `PlatformClient`                                                                                                                        | **Removes Forge as a blocking dependency.** Triage can start on day one                                                    |
| 2   | Manifest = `{name, server, app, skills, themes}`               | Manifest is **`.strict()`** and additionally **requires `description` and `branding`**; `engines` sits outside the `bb` key                                                                                                              | SPEC 00's manifest would have **failed validation**.

| 3   | Migrations are `migrations/NNNN_*.sql` files                   | `bb.storage.migrate(db, statements: string[])` — **inline TS string arrays**, append-only, `_bb_migrations` table                                                                                                                        | Changes the shape of every store WP                                                                                        |
| 4   | Agent tools can be individually approval-gated                 | **No per-tool approval field exists.** bb's generic approval UI applies uniformly and is not configurable                                                                                                                                | SPEC 06 §5.3's safety claim was wrong. The gate must be **architectural** (no push tool at all), not a UI setting          |
| 5   | Bench rack "enrolls as a bb host" — mechanism unknown          | **Resolved.** `bb.hosts` is tunnel-only. Enrollment is `bb.sdk.hosts.createJoinCode()` — the same call the "Add a machine" dialog makes — **but the target must run bb's `host-daemon` binary**, and threads are always server-initiated | The design works, with a real prerequisite. No longer `[UNVERIFIED]`                                                       |
| 6   | Bulk limits: deletes ≤100, review ≤500, VEX ≤500               | Platform VEX endpoint ceiling is **5000**, while v1 intentionally uses resumable client chunks of 500. Review bulk is **100, not 500**                                                                                                   | Chunking constants change                                                                                                  |
| 7   | `bb.http` is the main frontend↔backend bridge                  | **`bb.rpc`** is, with Standard Schema contracts. `bb.http` is for binary/large payloads only                                                                                                                                             | Confirms SPEC 00 §5, sharpens it                                                                                           |
| 8   | Firmware bytes are fetchable                                   | Direct Platform bytes require **org-admin `VIEW_ANY_PROJECT_FILE`**; ranged reads cap at **128 KiB**; full mode must stream                                                                                                              | Per-file hydration is bounded; local STP unpack remains the reliable fallback and a Platform tarball remains high leverage |
| 9   | A generic raw AS call can cover missing document APIs          | The public client must have a closed route set; AS binary routes need handler verification and explicit typed methods                                                                                                                    | Documents are **plugin-local in v1**; no raw escape hatch                                                                  |
| 10  | The bb plugin should connect to Forge for all Platform/AS data | Forge's clients are thin HTTP wrappers, while full Forge hard-requires PostgreSQL; its unique value is QEMU/dynamic verification, pen test, and compute-job orchestration                                                                | **Direct Platform + AS clients; Forge optional compute only.** Core works with Forge stopped                               |

**One more finding worth its own line:** `plugins/tasks/WORKERS.md` in the bb repo is literally a multi-agent build-coordination document for exactly this scenario. `AGENTS.md` is modeled on it.

## 1. Repo decision

> **Partly superseded — see `ADR — bb Is Not Modified.md` (accepted 2026-08-12).**
> The fork stands as a _development container_, but it is not a product artifact
> and **bb is never modified**. The "SDK changes (we will need some)" rationale
> below did not materialise and is withdrawn: no work package may change bb's
> source, its builtin plugins, or `builtin-registry.ts`. The product ships as an
> ordinary plugin installed with `bb plugin install`, and builtin registration
> (WP-02) is deferred as a BB release decision.

**Fork the bb monorepo. Develop at `plugins/bb-plugin-finite-state/`.**

|                                 | Fork the monorepo (chosen)                                           | Standalone repo via `bb plugin new`      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Workspace resolution            | Free — `pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs `plugins/*`                       | Manual                                   |
| Build step in dev               | **None** — `customConditions: ["source"]` resolves `@bb/*` to `src/` | Required                                 |
| UI components                   | Import `@bb/shared-ui` directly                                      | Vendor 44 components via shadcn registry |
| Reference implementation        | `plugins/tasks/` sits in-tree, copyable                              | Read-only reference                      |
| Test harness                    | `@bb/plugin-sdk/testing` wired                                       | Wired, but you own the config            |

| Cost                            | Carry a fork; rebase deliberately                                    | Clean separation                         |

**Rules for the fork:**

- Pin to a bb release tag. Rebase on a schedule, never mid-phase.
- **Everything we write lives under `plugins/bb-plugin-finite-state/`** with two enumerated exceptions (§4.3), so the plugin can be extracted to standalone later without archaeology.
- Any change outside that directory requires a note in `FORK-DELTA.md` explaining why it couldn't live inside.

```

**The anti-collision design, stated plainly:** the two composition roots (`server.ts`, `app.tsx`) are written **once, completely, in WP-01**, with every lane's registration call already present and pointing at a stub. After WP-01, **no lane ever edits a composition root.** A lane implements its own `lanes/<name>/register.ts` and the wiring is already there waiting for it.

This is the single most important structural decision in the plan. Without it, nine agents serialize behind two files.

---

## 4. The frozen interfaces

Max fan-out only works if the boundaries are settled before the lanes start. Five artifacts are frozen in Phase 0 and **may not be changed by a lane agent** — a change requires a human amendment and a broadcast to all lanes.

### 4.1 The five frozen files

| File                         | WP    | Contains                                                                 | Why frozen                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shared/contract.ts`         | WP-03 | Every RPC method signature for all nine surfaces                         | Frontend and backend lanes develop against it in parallel                  |
| `lib/store/schema.ts`        | WP-04 | Every SQLite table, as `bb.storage.migrate` statement arrays             | Migrations are append-only; two lanes inventing table 001 is unrecoverable |
| `lib/sync/registry.ts`       | WP-05 | `ENTITIES` — every entity, its class, dir/table, key function            | SPEC 01's core abstraction; every surface reads it                         |
| `lib/remote/types.ts`        | WP-06 | `PlatformClient`, `AssuranceStudioClient`, optional `ForgeComputeClient` | Production and mock implementations satisfy the same closed interfaces     |
| `test/mock-remote/fixtures/` | WP-08 | Recorded Platform/AS/compute corpus                                      | Every lane's tests assert against these bytes                              |

### 4.2 Amendment protocol

A lane agent that needs a frozen interface changed **stops and writes a one-paragraph amendment request** to `AMENDMENTS.md` with: the interface, the change, why the existing shape can't work, and which lanes it affects. It does not proceed on a local edit. A human merges the amendment, bumps `CONTRACT_VERSION` in `shared/contract.ts`, and notifies lanes.

**Expected rate: 3–6 amendments over the build.** Budget for them; they are a sign the freeze is doing its job, not failing.

### 4.3 The two sanctioned out-of-directory changes

1. `apps/server/src/services/plugins/builtin-registry.ts` + its two lockstep test files — **WP-02 only**, one time.
2. `.nvmrc` version correction — **WP-01 only**, one time.

Everything else outside `plugins/bb-plugin-finite-state/` needs a `FORK-DELTA.md` entry.

## 5. The nine lanes

| Lane                                    | Owns                                                               | Spec  | WPs             | Can start after                               |

**L4's canvas is a sub-lane.** It is ~2–2.5 weeks on its own and has no dependency on the other L4 work beyond the registry. Assign it a dedicated agent from the start.

### 5.2 SPEC 07/08 intake (added 2026-08-12, post-freeze)

SPECs 07 and 08 arrived after the frozen interfaces shipped, so their intake is
amendment-first: **WP-71 implements AMD-0010…AMD-0013 (plus the AMD-0014
dependency batch) as one consolidated change, and nothing in L9/L10 dispatches
before it merges.** The amendments are drafted as `proposed` in `AMENDMENTS.md`
and require the contract owner's approval.

Four facts that shape these lanes:

1. **They do not gate G4.** The Golden Loop demo bar is unchanged; the
   authoring-grade beat 11 lands post-G4 as WP-98 (Golden Loop v2). L9/L10 run
   as depth-pass lanes in parallel with G4→G6 work.
2. **They are local-first.** Neither lane mutates Platform or Assurance
   Studio; there are no new remote mocks (WP-10…13 untouched) and no new push
   paths. The six new ACTION tools invoke local subprocesses/hardware only
   (AMD-0013), and `fs_flash` carries the new `destructive` in-turn rule.
3. **They add host prerequisites bb cannot ship:** `kicad-cli` (KiCad 7+),
   a Python runtime for probe scripts, and per-instrument SDKs. Per FS-158,
   their absence keeps the plugin running and appears as an actionable advisory
   only on each dependent lane; plugin-global `needsConfiguration` is reserved
   for missing required credentials. Parsing/search/linking work with no KiCad
   installed; grounding works with no bench attached. Debug-mode tool
   gating and the authoring gate pipeline must be plugin-only mechanisms
   (`ADR — bb Is Not Modified.md`); WP-90 and WP-95 carry explicit
   stop-and-report feasibility checks.
4. **Two long leads start early:** the RE-corpus grounding (WP-97, the moat)
   and the KiCanvas go/no-go spike inside WP-74 (rendering only; the parser,
   cache, linking, and HBOM path never depend on the renderer).

### 5.1 Decision ownership and operational concurrency

The nine lanes describe product ownership, not permission to run nine agents immediately. FS-93 preserves all 70 WP keys and binds the 64 WPs that were still unstarted into 28 decision-owner clusters. The binding rule is strict: if one WP's acceptance criteria require a design choice owned by another, both packages use one owner and execute sequentially. The checked-in manifest is authoritative for this scheduling overlay and its validator prevents two sequential members from becoming concurrently ready.

The operational cap remains four until WP-10 through WP-13 are complete and dependency readiness passes. It then becomes **six lanes**. A later increase to **nine lanes** is conditional on nine independent active-or-ready decision clusters, workflow concurrency of at least nine, 45 GiB free after provisioning all worktrees, and a 35 GiB runtime free-space floor. A free slot never overrides an owner sequence.

Use `fs-critical` (Codex `gpt-5.6-sol`, `xhigh`) for L2 sync and the L4 canvas. Use `fs-standard` (the same model at `medium`) for routine/mechanical packages. Independent review uses `fs-review` (Claude Opus 5, `high`). Exact provider/model identifiers and the machine promotion command live in the manifest and coordinator runbook.

## 7. Remote-service mocks — the thing that makes fan-out possible

Nine lanes cannot share live customer services, and full Forge requires PostgreSQL at boot. **Independent Platform, Assurance Studio, and optional Forge-compute mocks are not a testing nicety; they are the parallelization enabler.** Core tests never boot Forge.

**Build path (WP-10…13), in order:**

1. **Generate from the vendored references.** Platform OpenAPI/audit and AS OpenAPI/handler notes live in `docs/Implementation/api-reference/` with source commit and SHA-256 provenance. Builds and tests do not reach into a sibling Forge checkout.
2. **Patch verified AS gaps** only from the handler-backed audit. The AS spec is knowingly incomplete; handler evidence wins when it disagrees. An unverified route stays absent rather than becoming a generic raw request.
3. **Layer known-drift corrections** recorded in the vendored endpoint audit and contract fixtures. Reproduce these quirks exactly at the raw mock boundary:
   - `/findings/{pv}/{fid}/cves` returns a **CVE-keyed dict**, not a list
   - severity counts nest as `{"bySeverity": {...}, "total": N}`
   - CSV export ends with a `# rows_written=N rows_skipped=M` footer
   - bulk-VEX envelope: `{status, summary{total,succeeded,failed}, results[{findingId,success,status,error}]}`
   - AS envelope: `{success: true, data: {items, total, page, pageSize, hasMore}}`, `page` 1-based, `pageSize` camelCase
4. **Add fault injection per service.** Produce 409 `stale_tara_state`, direct-Platform 403 on firmware bytes, 429 with `Retry-After`, partial bulk failure, strict-schema rejection, mid-push reset, and unavailable optional Forge compute. A failure in one mock must not take down the others.

**Seed corpus target:** one product version with **~4,000 findings** across ~180 components, a 12-node TARA model, 40 requirements, a 900-entry SBOM, and a 6,000-file firmware tree. Big enough that virtualization bugs surface; small enough to live in git.

## 8. Phase gates

Demo-complete-first: a thin vertical slice of all fourteen Golden Loop beats before any surface gets its depth pass.

| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G0** | Plugin loads in bb; nav renders; native `bb.settings.define`/`get`/`onChange` works; typed `connections.status` RPC reports three independent service mocks; CI green                                                                                                  | The scaffold, native configuration lifecycle, and service boundary are real without depending on WP-64 CLI |

| **G2** | Triage round-trips: agent writes YAML → `git diff` → `plan` → `push` to mock → base advances                                                                                                                                                                           | **The architecture is proven.** This is the moment the risk drops                                          |
| **G3** | Every Golden Loop beat executes, even if some are stubs                                                                                                                                                                                                                | No unknown unknowns remain                                                                                 |
| **G4** | Golden Loop runs end-to-end against the mock, **offline, from a warm cache**, unattended                                                                                                                                                                               | It's demoable                                                                                              |
| **G5** | Golden Loop runs against real Platform + AS on a real product; Forge-compute beats also pass when configured                                                                                                                                                           | It's true and degradation boundaries hold                                                                  |
| **G6** | Per-surface definition of done (SPEC 00 §12) met on all surfaces                                                                                                                                                                                                       | It's a product                                                                                             |

**G4 is the demo bar.** Everything between G4 and G6 is the depth pass and can be resequenced against whatever the demo feedback says. **SPECs 07/08 do not move any gate:** L9/L10 are depth-pass lanes, and the authoring-grade Golden Loop beat 11 (WP-98) lands after G4 as a v2 beat rather than raising the G4 bar.

**Hard rule at every gate:** `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck test lint build --filter=bb-plugin-finite-state` is green. A gate is not a vibe.

| L9 Hardware Design Plane       | ~5.5 wk                                      | 1–2                                              | post-G4 depth lane                           |
| L10 Firmware Authoring & Bench | ~11.5 wk (8i–8k and 8n deferrable/long-lead) | 2                                                | post-G4 depth lane                           |

Then **G4 → G6 is roughly another 4–5 weeks** of depth work at lower parallelism — and L9/L10 add ~17 agent-weeks on top, running in that same window and after. That is a near-half-again increase to the program; it is proportionate (SPEC 08 is the entire write direction) but it should be staffed as a deliberate decision, not absorbed silently.

**Reality adjustment:** these are agent-weeks, not human-weeks, and they assume competent review throughput. The operational cap is four now, six only after WP-10 through WP-13 and readiness validation, and nine only after the second conditional promotion gate. The binding constraint is usually **human review bandwidth and merge serialization**, not nominal owner demand. Plan for one reviewer per two or three active lanes, and expect the actual schedule to be set by how fast frozen-interface amendments get adjudicated.

## 11. Spikes to run before committing the schedule

Four unknowns are cheap to resolve now and expensive to discover in week four. Run these in parallel with WP-01.

| Spike  | Question                                                                                                              | Timebox | Kills / changes what                               |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **S1** | Does the AS canvas actually extract cleanly? Port one node type + elkjs layout into a bare bb panel                   | 3 d     | L4 sizing; possibly the whole canvas approach      |
| **S2** | Run `standalone_unpack.py` on a real firmware image outside STP. What's the true dependency footprint and wall-clock? | 2 d     | L6 approach; the mount's feasibility               |
| **S3** | Stand up a bb `host-daemon` on a spare Linux box and drive a trivial thread onto it                                   | 2 d     | The bench-as-threads design (R5)                   |
| **S4** | Generate independent mocks from the vendored API references and measure generated vs hand-written coverage            | 2 d     | The mock estimate, which sits on the critical path |

**Do not skip S4.** The mock's cost is the single largest estimation uncertainty in the plan.

## 12. Definition of done — the whole build

The plugin ships when SPEC 00 §12 is met on every surface, **and**:

- `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck test lint build --filter=bb-plugin-finite-state` is green
- The Golden Loop runs unattended, offline, from a warm cache — and again against live Platform + AS; optional compute beats pass with Forge configured
- Core pull, panels, and plan/push remain healthy with Forge stopped and no Forge database
- No lane has edited a composition root without an amendment entry
- `FORK-DELTA.md` accounts for every change outside the plugin directory
- Every `[UNVERIFIED]` marker in SPECs 00–06 is either resolved or converted into a filed platform ask
- The five platform asks are filed with owners: `/filesystem/export` tarball · `begin_tara_trial` exposure · `vexChangedAt` + `expected` precondition · `vex_source` column · `.strict()` PATCH audit
