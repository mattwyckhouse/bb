# AGENTS.md — `bb-plugin-finite-state`

_This file is read on every run. It is the standing contract for anyone — human or agent — writing code in this plugin. If something here conflicts with a work package, the work package wins for its own scope; if it conflicts with a SPEC, this file wins (it reflects code-level recon the specs predate)._

**Place this at `plugins/bb-plugin-finite-state/AGENTS.md` in the bb fork.**

---

## What this is

A bb plugin that turns bb from a coding IDE into the workspace where a connected product is designed, analyzed, secured, and proven. Nine surfaces (threat model, requirements, verifications, SBOM, HBOM, documents, verification bench, findings triage, sync) plus the firmware filesystem, in the same worktree as the source code, editable by both the human and the agent.

**The product principle that decides arguments:** _the agent and the human work on the same artifacts, through the same review flow, in one workspace._ If a feature needs the agent to have a private channel the human can't inspect, or needs the human to leave bb, it's wrong.

**Read before your first commit:** `IMPLEMENTATION PLAN — Master.md`, your own `tasks/WP-NN-*.md`, and the SPEC your lane implements. Skim `plugins/tasks/` in this repo — it is the reference implementation for nearly everything you'll need.

---

## Before you write a line

```bash
# from the repo root
pnpm install
pnpm exec turbo run typecheck test --filter=bb-plugin-finite-state
```

If that isn't green before you start, stop and say so. Don't build on a red tree.

---

## Non-negotiables

### 1. Never edit a composition root

`server.ts` and `app.tsx` were written **once**, completely, in WP-01. Every lane's registration call is already there, pointing at your stub.

```ts
// server.ts — DO NOT EDIT
export default async function plugin(bb: BbPluginApi) {
  const ctx = createPluginContext(bb);
  await registerRemoteServices(bb, ctx); // sole bb.settings.define owner; registers connections.status
  registerSync(bb, ctx);
  registerFindings(bb, ctx); // ← you implement lanes/findings/register.ts
  registerProductSecurity(bb, ctx);
  registerBom(bb, ctx);
  registerFirmware(bb, ctx);
  registerBench(bb, ctx);
  registerDocuments(bb, ctx);
  registerAgentic(bb, ctx);
}
```

You implement `lanes/<yours>/register.ts`. You do not touch the root. **CI fails the build if a composition root changes without an `AMENDMENTS.md` entry.**

### 2. Never edit a frozen interface

| File                   | Owner |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| `shared/contract.ts`   | WP-03 |
| `lib/store/schema.ts`  | WP-04 |
| `lib/sync/registry.ts` | WP-05 |
| `lib/remote/types.ts`  | WP-06 |

Need one changed? **Stop. Write to `AMENDMENTS.md`:** the interface, the change, why the current shape can't work, which lanes are affected. Then work on something else in your WP. Do not edit locally and do not work around it with a cast.

`test/mock-remote/fixtures/**` is **not** frozen (owner ruling, 2026-08-13 — the WP-08 freeze was retired). Fixture changes need no amendment, but they carry their own acceptance bar: see the fixture-fidelity rule under "The review kill list" below.

### 3. Stay in your directory

You own `lanes/<yours>/` and your tests. That's it. Anything outside `plugins/bb-plugin-finite-state/` needs a `FORK-DELTA.md` entry and a very good reason.

### 4. No new dependencies

Dependencies were frozen after WP-09 — `pnpm-lock.yaml` is 764KB, ordering-sensitive, and not human-mergeable, so every casual `pnpm add` costs someone an hour. Need a package? File an amendment. Someone batches lockfile changes daily.

`zod` is pinned repo-wide to **4.3.6** by a root override. Do not add another.

### 5. The agent never pushes

**There is no `fs_sync_push` tool and there will never be one.** bb has no per-tool approval mechanism — recon confirmed the registration contract has no `requiresApproval` field and bb's generic approval UI is not configurable per tool. So the human gate is **architectural, not a setting**: the capability simply does not exist in the agent's toolset.

Agent write tools mutate **local YAML only**. Eight tools are the enumerated ACTION exceptions: `fs_verification_run`, `fs_bench_run`, `fs_firmware_materialize`, `fs_hw_extract`, `fs_build`, `fs_flash`, `fs_serial`, and `fs_probe`. The first three may invoke server-side work; the five AMD-0013 additions are local-subprocess/local-hardware only. None mutates the authored model, and `fs_flash` is destructive-gated. **Adding a ninth requires a human decision recorded in `AMENDMENTS.md`.**

---

## How things actually work here (recon-verified — trust this over the specs)

### Manifest

The `bb` key is validated with **`.strict()`**. Unknown keys fail the load. `description` and `branding` are **required** — the specs omitted them.

```json
{
  "name": "bb-plugin-finite-state",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "engines": { "bb": ">=0.9", "bbPluginSdk": "^0.4.1" },
  "bb": {
    "name": "Finite State",
    "description": "Design, analyze, secure, and prove connected products.",
    "branding": { "icon": "./assets/fs-icon.svg" },
    "server": "./server.ts",
    "app": "./app.tsx",
    "skills": ["skills"],
    "themes": [
      {
        "id": "fsds-dark",
        "name": "Finite State Dark",
        "css": "./themes/fsds-dark.css"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Storage and migrations

Migrations are **inline TypeScript string arrays**, append-only, tracked in `_bb_migrations`. There is no `migrations/NNNN_*.sql` convention for plugins.

```ts
const db = bb.storage.database(); // <dataDir>/plugins/finite-state/data.db
bb.storage.migrate(db, MIGRATIONS); // append-only; never reorder or edit a shipped statement
```

Use real SQLite in tests. **Never mock sqlite** — that's a house rule from `plugins/tasks/WORKERS.md` and it's a good one.

`bb.storage.kv` exists for small JSON (≤256KB/row). Use it for cursors and preferences, not data.

### Frontend ↔ backend

**`bb.rpc` is the bridge, not `bb.http`.** Standard Schema contracts, served at `POST /api/v1/plugins/finite-state/rpc/<method>`, envelope `{ok:true,result} | {ok:false,error:{code,message,issues?}}`.

```ts
bb.rpc.register(contract, handlers);   // backend
const { data } = useRpc(...);          // frontend
```

`bb.http` is for **binary and large payloads only** — file uploads, XLSX/SBOM export streams. Mounted at `/api/v1/plugins/finite-state/http/<path>`, default `auth: "local"`. You get a raw Hono `Context`.

**The frontend cannot use `bb.sdk`.** RPC is the only path. Validate every input server-side.

### Realtime

```ts
bb.realtime.publish("findings:changed", { projectId }); // backend
useRealtime("findings:changed", handler); // frontend
```

**There are no per-channel subscriptions in v1** — the server fans out to every connected client and the client filters. So: treat a signal as _a hint to refetch_, never as a data channel, and keep payloads tiny. House naming style is `<entity>:changed`.

### Agent tools

```ts
bb.agents.registerTool({
  name: "fs_findings_query",
  description: "…",
  parameters: z.object({
    /* zod is the validated path */
  }),
  async execute(params, ctx) {
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result) }] };
  },
});
```

Return `string` or `{content: PluginAgentToolContentPart[], isError?: boolean}`. Tool sets apply at **next session start**, not hot-added mid-session.

### Directives

```ts
app.slots.messageDirective({
  id: "fs-finding",
  component: FindingDirectiveCard,
});
```

`id` must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$/`. **Attributes arrive as strings, always** — `Readonly<Record<string,string>>`, untrusted. Parse and validate them yourself. Components are ordinary React, so hooks and async fetching work.

### Mentions

Triggers available: `@ # $ ! ~`. `search()` runs server-side as the user types, **time-boxed at 2s**, failure-isolated. `resolve()` runs once at send time and returns `{context: string}` attached to the prompt — **throwing from `resolve()` blocks the send**, so never let it throw.

### Hosts (the bench)

`bb.hosts` is **tunnel-only** — `ensureSharedPortTunnel`, `declareSharedPorts`. It does not enroll.

Enrollment goes through the SDK escape hatch: `bb.sdk.hosts.createJoinCode()` — the same call bb's own "Add a machine" dialog makes. **The target machine must run bb's `host-daemon` binary** and redeem the code. Threads are always server-initiated onto the daemon; you cannot make an already-running external process "become" a thread.

### CLI

```ts
bb.cli.register({
  name: "finite-state", // lowercase, not a reserved name
  summary: "…",
  commands: [
    /* metadata only — rendered in help without executing plugin code */
  ],
  run(argv, ctx) {
    /* … */
  },
});
```

bb auto-generates a `plugin-commands` skill from the `commands` metadata. **Keep those summaries good — agents read them.** One registration per factory execution.

### Skills

`SKILL.md` with frontmatter `name` + `description`. **The directory name must exactly equal the frontmatter `name`.** Precedence is project > user > plugin > builtin, and name collisions are excluded — so namespace ours (`fs-triage`, not `triage`).

---

## UI rules

- **bb theme tokens only.** `bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`. No hex, no oklch, no arbitrary Tailwind colors. Lint enforces it.
- **Hugeicons only.** Never Lucide. Never emoji.
- **Import from `@bb/shared-ui`** — we're in the monorepo, so don't vendor via the shadcn registry.
- Vendored Radix gets `usePortalScopeProps()`.
- **Every domain component takes an `id` and self-fetches.** This is the convention that makes the directive layer nearly free: the same `<ThreatCard id="THREAT-22"/>` renders in a panel and inside an agent message. No wrappers, no prop-drilling.
- **Virtualize anything unbounded** (TanStack Virtual): findings, SBOM, filesystem, logs.
- **Four states, always designed:** loading (skeleton, not spinner) · empty (what to do next) · error (what failed + retry) · unconfigured (`bb.status.needsConfiguration`) for missing required credentials. Per FS-158, optional host executables, runtimes, SDKs, workspace sources, and local data never change the plugin lifecycle: keep the plugin running and expose an actionable advisory only on the dependent lane/surface.
- Density: compact rows, monospace for identifiers (CVE, hash, purl), right-aligned numerics, severity as **color plus label** — never color alone.

---

## Backend rules

- **Never keep `bb` in module state.** Register everything inside the factory; the factory reloads. Use `onDispose` for cleanup.
- **Never call any external service from a render path.** Platform and Assurance Studio calls happen in the plugin backend through named clients; optional Forge calls are compute jobs only. Sync into SQLite and serve paged RPC from there.
- Every list endpoint is paged: `{items, total, cursor}`.
- Chunk and rate-limit every bulk operation; make it resumable.
- Secrets live in plugin secret settings (0600 file). Never in the worktree, never in a diff, never in a log line.

---

## Remote-service facts worth knowing before you call them

- **Routine reads and writes go direct:** Platform operations use `PlatformClient`; TARA, requirements, verification records, and AS SBOM packages use `AssuranceStudioClient`. Forge is never a fallback proxy for either.
- **The route surface is closed.** There is no `as_raw_api`, generic fetch, arbitrary path/method API, or generic MCP tool invocation available to lanes, panels, CLI, or agents.
- Platform bulk VEX accepts up to 5000 records; the client chooses smaller resumable chunks and preserves per-item partial failures. Review bulk is **100** where the verified AS handler says so.
- Firmware bytes require the upstream permission documented in the vendored Platform references. **Per-file materialization of a large rootfs is not viable** — the primary path is STP's `standalone_unpack.py` locally.
- There is **no verified `/filesystem/export` tarball endpoint.** It's a filed ask, not a route to invent.
- Forge is optional compute only. Its async jobs return `job_id`; poll the named job method; terminal states are `COMPLETED | FAILED | TIMEOUT`; the result rides on the status response.
- Platform, AS, and Forge have independent settings, health, rate limits, and failure domains. Missing AS/Forge configuration disables only dependent surfaces/actions.
- Contract authority and provenance live in `docs/Implementation/api-reference/`; unknown or undocumented routes require reviewed evidence and a frozen-interface amendment.

**Develop against the remote-service mocks** (`test/mock-remote/`), not live services. Contract suites cover Platform, AS, and optional Forge compute independently. Full Forge needs PostgreSQL at boot and must not be required for core plugin tests.

---

## Testing

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=bb-plugin-finite-state
```

- Vitest. `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` beside the code.
- Backend: `createFakePluginHost({pluginId})` from `@bb/plugin-sdk/testing` → `{bb, harness}`. The harness gives you `callRpc`, `runCli`, `fetchHttp`, `callAgentTool`, `submitInteraction`, `runService`, `logEntries`.
- Frontend: `installTestPluginRuntime()` + `loadPluginApp(() => import("../app"))` + `renderSlot(...)` from `@bb/plugin-sdk/testing/app`.
- Real SQLite always.
- **Test the error paths.** The mocks can inject 409 `stale_tara_state`, 403 on firmware bytes, 429 with `Retry-After`, partial bulk failure, strict-schema rejection, mid-push connection reset, and an unavailable optional Forge compute service. If your WP touches a remote client, at least one test uses the relevant fault.

## The review kill list — attack your own work before you flag review

Ten consecutive WPs got zero first-pass approvals, and every round-1 blocker was a real defect. They cluster into a small number of classes, tracked in [REVIEW-KILL-LIST.md](./REVIEW-KILL-LIST.md) — attest against that list when you flag review. Five standing rules come out of it:

### 1. Registered-surface proof ("wired-in proof")

Every property you claim — gate, guard, validation, behavior — needs at least one test that exercises it **through the registered surface** (RPC dispatch, agent tool, panel or CLI path), not only the exported helper. A guard that holds on the export but is bypassed by the actual RPC is a round-1 blocker, and it has happened three times: FS-122 (send-confirm gate bypassed by the registered RPC), FS-74 (guard defeated by runtime registration), FS-108 (parser never invoked by any production path). Your PR body must name the production call path for each new module.

### 2. Real-fixture proof

Any parser or remote-client change must pass against at least one real-world artifact — a real KiCad file, a captured (sanitized) real API response — and mock fixtures must mirror the vendored reference shape, not a convenient simplification. FS-108 computed wrong connectivity on the repo's own real KiCad fixture; FS-164's real API nests the component object where every mock was flat.

**Fixture-fidelity rule** (owner ruling, 2026-08-13, replacing the retired WP-08 freeze): the purpose of the mock is that test data is **the exact same shape** as real API data — fixtures that simplify away real-world structure are defects, not conveniences. Fixture changes need no amendment, but every fixture change MUST (i) cite the vendored API reference or a captured real API response the new shape aligns with, and (ii) prove identity/stable-key compatibility so previously-accepted caches do not drift.

### 3. Adversarial self-test

For each MUST or guard in your WP, write the attack test that tries to defeat it — register the tool the allowlist doesn't enumerate, call the ungated path, spoof the evidence value — **before** flagging review. Your reviewer will attempt to defeat your guard; attempt it first. A guard nobody attacked shipped a ReDoS (FS-122, repair round).

### 4. Amendment echo table

If your WP implements signed amendment text, the PR body quotes each amendment constraint verbatim, each with the `file:line` and the test that satisfies it. FS-121 turned AMD-0013's "one mechanism and one test" into two mechanisms; FS-74's intake note said "nine" tools where the ratified union has eight. The echo table catches this drift mechanically.

### 5. Journey smoke (owner ruling, 2026-08-14)

Every WP or fix task defines **1–3 journey beats**: the primary user story walked through the registered surface — an RPC sequence, or an `agent-browser` path for UI work. Before flagging review, run the beats against a disposable dev instance with seeded mock data and attach the evidence (command output or screenshot) to the task. This extends rule 1 from "a test exists through the registered surface" to "the journey completes in a live instance": components that each pass their tests can still compose into a dead panel (FS-171/FS-172), a silent no-op (FS-168), or a first-use dead-end (FS-167) — every one of those escaped to a UX sweep and would have been caught by a two-minute journey walk. Reviewers treat missing journey evidence like missing wired-in proof: an immediate REQUEST_CHANGES without further analysis.

If the task fixes a sweep-found defect, the fix must also add a harness beat reproducing the broken journey once the WP-65 Golden Loop harness exists; until then, record the beat spec in [JOURNEY-BEAT-BACKLOG.md](./JOURNEY-BEAT-BACKLOG.md) for the WP-65 implementer to consume.

## Before you call a work package done

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run typecheck test lint build --filter=bb-plugin-finite-state
```

All four green, then check:

- [ ] Run `prettier --write` on your changed files before flagging review
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the WP is satisfied — quote each one and say how
- [ ] No composition root touched
- [ ] No frozen interface touched
- [ ] No new dependency
- [ ] Error paths tested, not just the happy path
- [ ] Every claimed gate/guard/behavior has a registered-surface test; the PR body names the production call path for each new module
- [ ] Parser/remote-client changes verified against a real artifact; fixtures mirror the vendored reference shape
- [ ] Attack tests written for every MUST/guard (see the review kill list above)
- [ ] Amendment echo table in the PR body, if the WP implements signed amendment text
- [ ] Journey beats (1–3) ran against a disposable dev instance + seeded mock; evidence attached to the task — and the beat spec recorded in JOURNEY-BEAT-BACKLOG.md if this fixes a sweep-found defect
- [ ] All four UI states exist, if you built UI
- [ ] No secret, no absolute local path, no `console.log` left behind
- [ ] `[UNVERIFIED]` or `TODO` markers either resolved or explicitly listed in your summary

**Commit prefix: `fs plugin: `**

**If you're blocked, stop and say so.** A clear blocker written down beats a clever workaround every time — especially a cast that silences a type error at a frozen boundary. That kind of workaround is how nine parallel lanes quietly diverge.
